Overall structure:
1. Create 3x3 images by calculating difference between frame n and n+k, where k > 0
2. Interpolate images (240x240?) and create contour map
3. Train yolo 
4. Evaluate

Creating difference images:
- Vary k, evaluate effects
- try log differences

Interpolation:
- What is a good resolution to interpolate to?
